    <!--  This is an example how to specify the description of operators and the translation of it's key identifier
    to names. 

   <operator>
      <name>SingleTextInput</name>
      <synopsis>Generates word vectors from a single text.</synopsis>
      <help />
   </operator>
   <operator>
      <name>TextObjectWriter</name>
      <synopsis>Writes a textobject into a file.</synopsis>
      <help>This operator writes a given textObject into a file. It might be specified if an existing file with the same name should be overwritten.</help>
   </operator>

    This is how group ids are translated:
    
   <group>
      <key>text_processing</key>
      <name>Text Processing</name>
   </group>

    -->
   <operator>
      <name>Extract Gender</name>
      <synopsis>GendRE Genderizer infers the gender from international names.</synopsis>
      <help>
          This operator infers the gender from international names (male/female), calling the GendRE API. 
          Input: first_name, last_name and (optionally) a country (ISO2 code), a batch_id. 
          Output: gender_scale [-1..0..+1=Female] and gender {Male,Female,Unknown}.
          GendRE API can use both the first_name and last_name (ex. for Slavic names, to deambiguate names like Andrea male in Italy, female in the US, ...)
          GendRE API is free to use with certain restrictions. Please also consider our commercial offering, with additional support and features.
